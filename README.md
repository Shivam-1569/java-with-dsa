## Folder Structure



## Java Preparation

### Basics
In the `basics` folder, you will find code examples and explanations covering fundamental Java concepts such as variables, data types, control structures, and functions.

### Data Structures
The `data-structures` folder includes implementations and explanations for various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and trees.

### Algorithms
The `algorithms` folder contains implementations and explanations for sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and other important algorithms.

## Code Examples
Explore the code examples within each section to better understand how these concepts and algorithms are implemented in Java.

## Resources
